This takehome test should take you under an hour to complete.

To do this test, take the following steps:

1. Fork this repository (as you do not have permissions to write into it).
2. Make the code in the directory `explore_the_five` work. Note that you
   may encounter some discrepancies depending on how you load the data.
   Be prepared to explain why discrepancies occur, if they did.
3. Submit a pull request with your results.

And that's all you need to do.
